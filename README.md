# capstone-spring-2025

## Description:

This is the Spring 2025 Capstone repository for Ahmed's team. It will be further developed with actions and GitLive and such as the project progresses and more concrete decisions are made.

## Main and Dev Branches:

_When pushing new changes to main_, a pull request must be submitted and reviewed by at least one other person. The main branch is for tested production code only. All development and testing should happen in either the dev branch or a feature/bugfix branch.

## Features and Bugfixes:

_For implementing new features_, please create a new branch using the naming convention:

`feature/feature-name-goes-here`

_For bug fixes_, please create a new branch using the naming convention:

`bugfix/bug-fix-goes-here`

The important part is to use the `feature/` or `bugfix/` prefix, which will allow us to stay organized and quickly locate branches based on category.
